## Jacqueline Carroll -- Bioinformatics Data Scientist | Environmental Toxicology | Marine Microbiome Research

Welcome to my GitHub portfolio! I am a graduate student researcher focused on  bioinformatics data science and environmental toxicology. I am interested in how contaminants move through ecosystems and affect human health. My current research focuses on human and marine exposure to Per- & Polyfluoroalkyl Substances (PFAS), microbiome modeling, transcriptomics and survey-based exposure assessment. 

## Research Interestes:
- PFAS Exposure and Toxicokinetics: Modeling contaminant exposure in human health and ecosystems
- Microbiome Analysis: 16s community profiling, functional gene inference and microbial interactions with contaminants
- Transcriptomic Analysis: Differential gene expression, functional enrichment analysis
- Environmental Health Informatics: Integrating survey, lab and public datasets to better understand exposure pathways
- Reproducible Science: Data cleaning pipelines, tidyverse workflows, automated reports and version-controlled analysis

## Project portfolio:
Several of my active projects are still in progress and not yet public. Until they're ready, feel free to check out my earlier projects! They showcase classwork, independent study and the building blocks of my current research.
